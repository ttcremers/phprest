#summary What annotations are available and what do they do?

=Class Annotations=
||`@XmlRoot`||Specify what the root element of the XML representation for this class will be.||
||`@XmlNamespace`||Specify the namespace this document will use.||


=Property Annotations=
||`@XmlIncludeWhenEmpty`|| Includes the property in the output XML, even when it's unset. This will of course result in an empty element or attribute.||
||`@XmlContainerElement`|| Provides a "wrapping" element for the property. Use in combination with `@XmlAttribute`.||
||`@XmlElement`||This property will be represented as an XML element, with it's string representation as TextNode. The element name will be the property name.||
||`@XmlRef`||The referenced object's XML representation will be a child node in this object's XML representation.||
||`@XmlRef`||Like `@XmlRef`, but on an array of values||
||`@XmlRefLink`|| The referenced object will be represented by an element containing a link attribute to this object's resource, provided a `LinkResolver` is available.||
||`@XmlRefLinkMany`||Like `@XmlRefLink`, but on an array of values||
||`@XmlAttribute`||This property's string representation will be presented as an attribute to the parent attribute. This will be the class' root node, unless `@XmlElement` is present as well.||
||`@XmlTextnode`||The value of this scalar value will be the nodeValue of the parent element||
