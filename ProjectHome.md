phpREST is a flexible and easy to use RESTful framework. It's still at an early stage of development.

**Warning: The frameworks are in early development, and not recommended for production use. Besides the bugs, the API is highly unstable and may change without notice.**

There has been no official release yet so code is only available from [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/phprest/source/checkout).

The phpREST project is made out of 4 sub projects

  1. **lib-phpREST** RESTful classes.
  1. **lib-ReflectionAnnotate** Classes for working with annotations in php.
  1. **lib-XMLShift** XML Marshalling classes (uses lib-ReflectionAnnotate)
  1. **phpREST-Skeleton** A clean example project.

Development is done with [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) and the [PDT](http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/) plugin so the projects can be directly checked out in your [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) environment.
